        Chinese New Year Legend No. 2: The Calendar of the Ten Thousand Years of Creation
      </h2>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>According to legend, in ancient times, there was a young man named Wannian, who saw that the festival was very chaotic at that time, and had the intention to set the festival in order. But the bitter can not find a way to calculate the time, one day, he went up to the mountains to cut firewood tired, sitting in the shade of a tree to rest, the movement of the tree inspired him, he designed a measurement of the sun and shadow counting the time of day sundial, the determination of the time of day, and later, the cliffs on the drip of the fountain inspired him to inspiration, and his hands to do a five-tiered funnel pot, to calculate the time. Over time, he realized that every 360 days or so, the four seasons would rotate and the length of the day would repeat itself.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The king of the country at that time was called Zu Yi, and he was also often distressed by the unpredictability of the weather winds and clouds. Wannian knew, took the sundial and funnel pot to see the emperor, to Zuyi clear reasoning for the operation of the sun and the moon. Zu Yi listened to the dragon's face, feel reasonable. So left Wannian, in front of the Temple of Heaven to build the Sun and Moon Pavilion, built the sundial and funnel kiosk. And hope to be able to measure the sun and moon law, project the accurate morning and evening time, create the calendar, for the benefit of the people of the world.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Once, Zu Yi went to find out the progress of the Ten Thousand Years Test Calendar. When he ascended to the altar of the Sun and the Moon, he saw a poem engraved on the stone wall beside the Temple of Heaven:
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="quote">
        <p>The sun rises and sets three hundred and six times, and the cycle begins again from the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>The grass and trees wither and prosper in four seasons, and there are twelve rounds in a year.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Knowing that Wannian had created the calendar, he personally climbed up to the Sun and Moon Pavilion to visit Wannian. Wannian pointed to the sky and said to Zuyi: “It is now the fullness of twelve months, the old year is over, the new spring begins again, I pray that the king of the country to set a festival”. Zu Yi said, “Spring is the first day of the year, let's call it Spring Festival”. This is said to be the origin of the Spring Festival. As winter turned to spring, year after year, Wannian, after a long period of observation and careful projection, formulated an accurate solar calendar, which was full of silver whiskers when he presented it to the succeeding ruler of the country. The king of the country was deeply touched, in order to commemorate the achievements of Wan Nian, the solar calendar named “Wan Nian Calendar”, Wan Nian as the sun and moon life star. Later on, people put up a picture of the star of longevity on New Year's Day, which is said to be in honor of the highly respected Wannian.</p>

      <h2>Chinese New Year Legend No. 3: Posting Spring Festival Couplets and Door Gods</h2>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The custom of putting up Spring Festival couplets is said to have started about a thousand years ago in the Later Shu period, which is supported by history. In addition, according to the Jade Candle Canon, the Yanjing Yearly Record and other writings, the original form of the Spring Festival couplets is what is known as the “Peach Symbol”.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>In ancient Chinese mythology, there is a world of ghosts, in which there is a mountain with a big peach tree covering 3,000 miles, and a golden rooster at the top of the tree. Whenever the golden rooster crowed in the morning, the ghosts that had gone out to roam at night would be rushed back to the ghost world. The gate of the Ghost Realm was situated in the northeast of the peach tree, and by the gate stood two godmen named Shentan and Yubi. If a ghost did something harmful at night, the gods would immediately find it, catch it, tie it up with a rope made of mango reeds, and feed it to the tiger. Therefore, all the ghosts in the world were afraid of Shentian and Yubi. So the folk used peach wood to carve into their likeness and put it in front of their house to avoid evil and prevent harm. Later, people simply carve the name of God Tantui and Yubi on the mahogany board, thinking that this can also suppress the evil to go to the evil. This kind of mahogany board was later called “peach talisman”.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>To the Song Dynasty, people began to write couplets on the mahogany board, one does not lose the significance of mahogany to suppress evil, the second is to express their good wishes, the third is to decorate the portal, in order to beautiful. And write couplets on red paper to symbolize the joy and auspiciousness of the New Year, posted on both sides of the doors and windows, to express people's prayers for good luck in the coming year.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>In order to pray for a family's well-being, people in some places still retain the habit of sticking door gods. It is said that if two door gods are posted on the front door, all demons and ghosts will be afraid. In folklore, the door god is a symbol of righteousness and force, the ancients believed that the strange-looking people often have magical endowments and extraordinary skills. They are upright and kind-hearted, to catch ghosts and demons is their nature and responsibility, people look up to the ghost hunter Zhong Kui, that is, this kind of strange looks. So the folk god of the door is always angry eyes, grim-looking, holding a variety of traditional weapons, ready to fight with the ghosts and demons that dare to come to the door. Since the doors of residential houses in China usually open in pairs, the door gods are always in pairs.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>After the Tang Dynasty, in addition to the previous two generals Shentian and Yubi, people also took Qin Shubao and Yuchigong, two Tang Dynasty military generals, as door deities. According to legend, Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty was sick and heard the ghosts and demons outside his door, which made him feel uneasy all night long. So he asked these two generals to stand beside the door with weapons to guard it, and the next night there were no more ghosts to disturb him. Later, Emperor Tang Taizong had the images of the two generals painted and pasted on the door, and this custom began to be widely spread among the people.</p>
